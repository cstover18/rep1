You don’t always need to peel peaches for peach pie. The skins are edible, and they’ll add a nice rustic look to desserts, like in these grilled peach sundaes. Just be sure to wash the peaches well before use. Should you opt to peel your peaches, we recommend this blanching method: Cut a shallow “x” in the bottom of the peach, then place the peach in boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove the peach from the boiling water and immediately plunge it into a bowl of ice water. This will cause the skin to “shrink” up and start pulling away from the peach flesh. Starting at the “x” cut in the bottom, carefully use your fingers or a paring knife and strip off the peach skin. It should easily remove, though you may still need to peel some stubborn spots (depending on the ripeness of your peach) with a paring knife.
